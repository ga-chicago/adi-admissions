* **Is there homework?** Yes, 2-5 nights a week. Optional reading and activities are also assigned.
* **What kind of computer(s) do the instructors use?** A Macbook Pro.
* **What's the best price on a Mac?** Apple has an [official refurbished site](http://www.apple.com/shop/browse/home/specialdeals/mac). We have seen Macbooks as low as US$750 on it before. And yes, we do recommend AppleCare and there is an Apple Store 4 blocks away that can perform same-day service if you have it.
* **Can I use Linux?** Yes, if you can:
  - Install it yourself
  - Research terminal commands for Linux (ps: try to learn as much as you can prior)
